# Be careful opening a file in write mode ('w') because if the file does exist,
# python will erase the contents of the file before returning the file object.


# read mode ('r'), write mode ('w'), append mode ('a').
# a mode that allows you to read and write to the file ('r+').
# The open() function automatically creates the file youâ€™re writing to if it doesn't exist.

# This program doesn't have a terminal out put.
# But if you open the file programming.txt you'll see the line we wrote.
# Run the program and the txt file will be made with these lines written here.
